Notes from Thomas Okken
=======================

"Annunciators" refers to the status indicators at the top of the display, 
above the dot matrix area. 
The HP-42S, Free42, and Plus42 have seven of them; from left to right, 
they are ?? (multi-row menu indicator), shift, printing, running, low battery, G, and RAD.

I refer to the top line of the Plus42 display, where you see { HOME }, 
and optionally BASE and TVM modes etc., as the "header."
